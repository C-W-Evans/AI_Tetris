###################################### PROMPT 1
Below in quotes is a first version of a prompt I will make for you to design and code a tetris game. Please let me know if anything is unclear or if any changes can be made to improve it.

"I have to code a two player tetris game with python with tkinter. This game is to be coded and run locally. One player is the user and the other is an AI that will position the peices automatically.

could you first give me the structure needed for the project and then the necessary code for each file in the structure.

Be careful to make sure the project structure and code is as simple and efficient as possible to enable easy functionality modularity and avoid bugs.

When projet code is run two tetris grids should be visible, one for each player (the user and the AI) The user will use the arrow keys to move the falling tetris piece. Right for right, left for left, down to accelerate the drop speed and up to rotate clockwise. The AI will place the peices automatically without thinking to much, taking the easiest best option.

Above each tetris grid the score for each player should be displayed and updated as the game is being played. Here is the scoring system : 50 points for 1 line, 100 for two lines, 200 for three lines, 300 for four lines.

Here are some extra fun functionalities I would like.
- When one player completes two lines at once, the other player receives a square or a sraight line for their next peice.
- Every 1000 points scored in total, the peices should fall 20% slower for 10 seconds.
- Every 3000 points scored a special peice should appear, i.e. a star or a heart, they bring 100 points if they are correctly placed. (They should act as squares)
- Every 2 minutes the peices change colour for 20 seconds."

###################################### PROMPT 2
Lets refine the initial requirements first. Here are my answers to each one of your points. Could you then give me the project structure and related code for each file in the structure?

1. The AI should always aim to complete the lowest gap in the top line.
2. The game ends after 5 minutes or after either of the player's grid fills to the top.
3. The initial speed of the tetris blocks should not be slow or fast.
4. The special peices should appear as regular red hearts or yellow stars and be roughly the same dimensions as the square peice in the game and act as a square as is it fills 4 squares in the tetris grid as a square does.
5. the colour change every 2 minutes is purely visual, every peice in the game should change colour to other different colours to the classic tetris colours.
6. There is no peuse functionality
7. This replaces their next peice.
8. A classic tetris game interface

###################################### PROMPT 3
You have given me the code for all the files in the structure appart from the main. Could you give this to me?

Also please double check that all the code you have given me is refactored and as modulable as possible and let me know of any possible improvments this considered.

###################################### PROMPT 4
The AI player seems to be able to make the peices instantly appear at the bottom rather than fall at the same pace as the human player's peices can. The ai player should only be able to make the peices fall as fast as the human player when the human player pushes on the down arrow. Could you fix this? 

Also could you make the peices fall 15% faster than their current default speed?

Could we also change the game to only last 3 minutes?

Also at the end of the game the program crashes. Fix this.

###################################### PROMPT 6
take out the hard drop possibility for the AI, only the human user should be able to do it with the space bar

###################################### PROMPT 7
the peices seems to accelerate at the game goes on which i don't want. However could the starting speed be 15% faster?

###################################### PROMPT 8
could we also have the AI player always pushing down to make a fast drop?

###################################### PROMPT 9
check that when either player completes 2 lines at once, the other player receives a square or a straight line?

###################################### PROMPT 10
check to be sure because I've just tested it and it doesn't seem to work. the other player should receive a line or a square if thier opponents completes two lines at the same time

###################################### PROMPT 11
how do I take away the time limit on the game? the game should just end with the first to 5000 points or when either grid is full up

###################################### PROMPT 12
the colour change after two minutes did not happen either, do you need any more information about what I would like in order to implement it?

###################################### PROMPT 13
it seemed to kind of work but then it creashed. The colour change should just last 20 seconds, every two minutes. At the end of the 20 seconds, the normals colour should come back for another 2 minutes and so on

###################################### PROMPT 14
It crashed again, what information do you need to know why it is crashing and solve the problem?

###################################### PROMPT 15
could you add a timer to the game so I can see what time these crashed happen?

###################################### PROMPT 16
I've just done 4 tests, it crashed the first three times at these times, 1.48, 3.36, 1.31 and then ended correctly on the 4rth time.

###################################### PROMPT 17
the same "python not responding" crash happened, this time at 2.27 minutes. anything else I can do to help you find the bug fix?

###################################### PROMPT 18
do you see any other possibilities for bugs or opportunities to refactor the code to make it more modulable and stable?

###################################### PROMPT 19
I think you've overcomplicated the script and now there is just too much that can go wrong. Can you take it back a bit to before I was reporting crashes?

###################################### PROMPT 21
so it worked for very long which is great, butit crashed after 4.30 mins. any way to simplify the code even more?
